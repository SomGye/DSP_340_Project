# DSP_340_Project
A set of classes and functions for Digital Signal Processing in CSC-340 (Scientific Computing).

This project explores Fast Fourier Processing of Sine/Cosine wave signals and two-dimensional signals such as images, as well as Power Spectral Densities of the positive frequencies within signal data.

Inverse and Forward Fast Fourier Transforms are supported for 1D list data and 2D arrays.

This project uses NumPy and OpenCV.
